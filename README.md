# Skyvee
Welcome and thank you for collaborating with this project. Please note that Skyvee is in Portuguese ... just for now. Future versions will change the main language to English.

## But ... what's a "Skyvee"?
Skyvee is a cross-platform cloud-based virtual desktop that allows you to create a simulation of a standalone operating system with its native applications and file system without dependency on the machine's operating system. Skyvee allows you to browse your files and interact with your applications on any device with an internet connection, USB support, memory card support or any other storage device you choose to store Skyvee.
But this is only for now!
Skyvees' mission is to run on a clean linux distro with nothing more than a Window Manager in order to be pre-installed in machines and sold to customers.

## Do you have the courage to test it?
Skyvee is in early development and so doesn't have an executable file prepared. To test it, download the project source and, inside the folder, just do the magic of npm install & npm start.
```
cd path/to/Skyvee/source
npm install
npm start
```
If you don't have Node, download it from https://nodejs.org

### OMG, I get an error when I try to run it!
That's normal. Maybe your OS or OS version may not match the one in the configuration files. There is a docs solution dedicated to this subject: https://github.com/rodrifelix99/SkyveeOS/wiki/Build-errors, just check it out and you'll be A-OK!

### What if I want to create apps for Skyvee
That's great! Skyvee needs to amplify its App Store and your app is more than welcome to join the collection. If you need help on how to create apps using Skyvees' native script language, just check out the docs: https://github.com/rodrifelix99/SkyveeOS/wiki/Creating-apps-for-Skyvee

## What? A bug?!
Of course, this is something that was already expected! The main reason Skyvee needs help from the community is for bug elimination and development of new features (core improvements are also accepted ðŸ˜˜).
**If you find a bug, report it in the "Issues" section.**

## See that? That's pure magic
Skyvee is developed using the Electron Framework that converts pure JavaScript to native applications. It's that simple: **pure JavaScript**

## Do I need a J.A.R.V.I.S. type machine to run it?
Well ... no. You just need something like this:
#### Windows
Windows 7 and later are supported, older operating systems are not supported (and do not work).
Both x86 and amd64 (x64) binaries are provided for Windows. Please note, the ARM version of Windows is not supported for now.
#### Mac
Only 64bit binaries are provided for macOS, and the minimum macOS version supported is macOS 10.10 (Yosemite).
#### Linux
The prebuilt ia32(i686) and x64(amd64) binaries of Electron are built on Ubuntu 12.04, the arm binary is built against ARM v7 with hard-float ABI and NEON for Debian Wheezy.

## My great-aunt has a funny suggestion, where do I post it?
All suggestions, criticisms, opinions and reports of problems are welcome in the "Issues" section. All suggestions are taken into consideration, don't be shy.

**May the JavaScript be with you**
